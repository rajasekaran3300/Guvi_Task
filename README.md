# Overview
This project is a **User Authentication System** built using **HTML, JavaScript, PHP**, and a combination of **MySQL** and **MongoDB** databases. It provides basic functionality for user registration, login, and profile management. Users can sign up, log in, and update their profile details. The frontend is designed using Bootstrap for styling, while the backend handles data storage in MySQL for login credentials and MongoDB for additional user information.

# Technologies & Tools
- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Databases**: 
  - **MySQL** for storing user credentials.
  - **MongoDB** for storing additional user details like interests and location.
- **AJAX**: For handling asynchronous data requests to PHP scripts.

# Features
- **User Registration**: Allows users to create a new account by providing a username (email) and password.
- **Login Functionality**: Verifies user credentials from the MySQL database, and upon successful login, redirects the user to their profile page.
- **Profile Management**: Users can view and update their profile information (location, interests) stored in MongoDB.
- **AJAX Integration**: Uses AJAX for smooth, asynchronous updates of registration, login, and profile updates without reloading the page.
